Introduction
=============

Pyzefir is used to build and configure a specific class of mathematical optimization models that represent a given
energy system. This System is clearly defined by identifying sources, transmission infrastructure and energy customers.
The processes provided in the model are the acquisition, transfer and processing of various types of energy to meet
the needs of consumers.

In the model, we distinguish between the supply side (energy sources) and the demand side (energy consumers).
The key relationship that must occur in the model is the balance relation, which assumes that in each analyzed hour the
volume of energy supplied to customers is equal to their energy demand.

The tool aims to find the solution of the optimization by determining how – with the given scenario
assumptions – the technological structure of the given energy system will change over the next years.
Subjects to optimize are the total cost of maintenance (operating costs), modernization (investment costs)
and operation (variable costs) of a given energy system.

The elements of the energy system represented in the tool are energy carriers, energy sources, energy storage facilities,
transmission infrastructure elements and energy consumers.
